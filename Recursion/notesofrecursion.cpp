//Recursion Start

//Lets Start

//Recursion--> when a function calls itself until 
//a specified condition is met

//E.g--> 
//void f(){
//print(1)
//f();}
//int main(){ --> firsly it comes to the main function
//f();--> calls the function f
//}


//Base Case -> Specified condition is met 
//Stack Overflow--> it depends on the size of the index
//Recursion tree is basixally the same as recursion the inly difference is that 
//the f(); is called in a manner and not in the full fucntion way 

// f()->f()->f()->f();
